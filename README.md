# CubePlay
This is my first unity project and a practice from a youtube tutorial.<br>
There are three different levels from easy to hard and you should go through the obstacles without collision with cubes. If you hit the cubes or fall down from the playground you lose.<br>
You can get the installer for windows from Installer v2.0 folder. You need to run the .exe file. You may get a security allert since I haven't purchased a code signing certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority. But you can click on more info and then run anyway.
